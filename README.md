**Project Title: Dashboard development**

The goal of this task was to design a fully functional dashboard that enables decision-makers to analyze business trends, identify growth opportunities, monitor key preformance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard was designed to be interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing, providing a clear understanding of the company's overall performance through dynamic data visualizations.

**Process and Approach**

**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The dataset was first loaded into Power BI, and data cleaning stepes were performend using Power Query Editor. Missing values were handled, data types were corrected, and unnecessary columns were removed to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

**2. Data Modeling**: Calculated columns and measures were created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful metrics such as Total sales, Total profit, Profit Margin, and Sales Growth Rate.

**3. Dashboard Design and Visualization**: The dashboard was designed following a structured layout to highlight key metrics at a glance.
a.) **KPIs**: Total saels, Total Profit, Average Discount, and Profit Margin.
b.) **Visuals Used**: Bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, and map visualizations to show regional performance.
c.) **Filter and slicers**: Implemented for Category, Region, and Segment to enable users to explore data dynamically.
d.) **Trend Analysis**: Time-based visuals to analyze monthly and yearly sales and profit trends.
e.) **Geographical Insights**: A filled map showing regional sales distribution across different states.

**4. Interactivity and Insights**: This dashboard allows user to drill down into specific product categories, customer segment, or regions to uncover performance insights. For example, user can identify which product categories contribute the most profit, which regions perform below average, and how discount level affect profitability.

**Key Insights**
1. The techonoly category generated the highest profit, while Furniture showed lower profitability due to higher discounts.
2. The West region performend best overall, while the Central region had improvement potential.
3. Seasonal trends revealed that sales peaked during the end of the year, indicating promotional opportunities.

**Conclusion**

The Power BI dashboard successfully transformed raw sales data into meaningless business intelligence.It enables management to make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive overview of performance across regions,products,and time periods.This project enhanced my understanding of data visualization principles ,KPI tracking , and dashboard storytelling - key skills for any aspiring data analyst.
